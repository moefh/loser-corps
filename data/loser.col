# The L.O.S.E.R Corps - color correction
#
# This file specifies the color correction for the game.
# The correction will be applied to the palette (when run under 8bpp) or
# to each pixel of the images (when in 16 or 32bpp).
#
# Values are in the range -255 to 255.
#

# This is for dark monitors (suggested by 1/2):
#r = 32
#g = 27
#b = 15

# Use this to get a "night" cenario:
#r = -32
#g = -32
#b = -32

# This is the game default:
r = 0
g = 0
b = 0
